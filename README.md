# Data-analysis project for Greate learning academy (Master Data Analytics in SQL & Excel Final project)
Terro's Real Estate Agency Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the factors that impact housing prices for Terro's Real Estate Agency, where the goal is to understand the relationship between various property and neighborhood characteristics and the median house value (MEDV). As an Auditor, your primary task is to evaluate and quantify these relationships to provide actionable insights to the agency.
Project Objectives
The objective is to map and analyze several property attributes and geographic features to determine their influence on house prices. Through this analysis, Terro’s Real Estate Agency aims to gain a data-driven understanding of the factors that drive house prices, which will support strategic decision-making.
Dataset
The dataset includes information on 506 houses in Boston and contains the following features:
•	CRIME_RATE: Per capita crime rate by town
•	INDUSTRY: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town (in percentage terms)
•	NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
•	AVG_ROOM: Average number of rooms per house
•	AGE: Proportion of houses built before 1940 (in percentage terms)
•	DISTANCE: Distance from the nearest highway (in miles)
•	TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
•	PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
•	LSTAT: Percentage of the lower status population
•	AVG_PRICE: Average value of houses in $1000's (Target Variable: MEDV)
Analysis Topics Covered
The analysis covers the following statistical and data science methods:
1.	Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing and describing the main features of the dataset.
2.	Covariance and Correlations: Evaluating the relationships and dependencies between variables.
3.	Simple Linear Regression: Analyzing the impact of individual features on house prices.
4.	Multiple Linear Regression: Modeling the combined influence of multiple features on house prices.
Key Deliverables
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an initial analysis to understand the distribution and relationships among variables.
2.	Statistical Analysis: Use covariance and correlation to identify strong and weak relationships between features and house prices.
3.	Regression Modeling: Build and interpret Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models to quantify the influence of features on housing prices.
4.	Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide insights into the key drivers of house prices in Boston, enabling the agency to make informed investment and advisory decisions.
Results and Insights
This analysis provides a comprehensive look into the factors that influence house prices in Boston, allowing Terro’s Real Estate Agency to identify trends, high-impact variables, and areas of improvement for targeted housing investments and services.
